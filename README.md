# WeatherApp
A Weather App built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS and using OpenWeatherMapAPIs.
Took inspiration from 'Devression' channel on youtube building the same application (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74IOjtVvExY).

I refactored the whole code to make it more readable and to improve its performance, also styling it according to my taste (Like usingfont-awesome icons)

Use: If you want the app to properly be functional, register to OpenWeatherMap site and put your API key in the proper field in app.js.
